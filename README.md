# Distance-converter
Distance converter (miles to kilometers and vice-versa) built using Python and Tkinter.

To run this program simply, run the main.py file in a Python environmnent/IDE (I use PyCharm).

The goal of this small program was simply to get my feet wet with Tkinter and make my first GUI program.
